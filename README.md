# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple calculator that computes the simple interest based on the given principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula

The simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times T \times R \]

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **T** = Time period in years
- **R** = Annual rate of interest (as a decimal or percentage)

## Input
The program requires the following inputs:
- `P`: Principal amount (numeric value)
- `T`: Time period in years (numeric value)
- `R`: Annual rate of interest (numeric value)

## Output
The program computes and returns the simple interest based on the provided inputs.

## Example

```python
# Example usage in Python
P = 1000  # Principal amount
T = 5  # Time period in years
R = 0.05  # Annual rate of interest (5%)

simple_interest = P * T * R
print(f"Simple Interest: {simple_interest}")
```

### Expected Output:
```
Simple Interest: 250.0
```

## Usage
This calculator can be implemented in any programming language that supports basic arithmetic operations. It can be useful for financial applications, educational purposes, or personal finance calculations.
